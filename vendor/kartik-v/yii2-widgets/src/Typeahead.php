/**
 * Typeahead widget is a Yii2 wrapper for the Twitter typeahead.js plugin. This
 * input widget is a jQuery based replacement for text inputs providing search
 * and typeahead functionality. It is inspired by twitter.com's autocomplete search
 * functionality and based on Twitter's typeahead.js which Twitter mentions as
 * a fast and fully-featured autocomplete library.
 *
 * This is an advanced implementation of the typeahead.js plugin included with the
 * Bloodhound suggestion engine.
